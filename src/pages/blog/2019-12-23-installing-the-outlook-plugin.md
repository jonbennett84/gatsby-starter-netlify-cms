**Installing the Matter Centre outlook plugin is really easy.**



## My plugin keeps disappearing?

If you are finding that your Matter Centre Outlook plugin keeps disappearing this maybe because of your Outlook settings. Outlooks default settings are to disable plugins that it thinks is slowing down the program. You disable this option by going to:

File> Info> Slow and Disabled COM add-ins

You should then see the MCOutlookAddin in this list.

You will next need to click the Options accordion to be presented with the choice to Always enable this add-in.

Click this option then apply to ensure the plugin never gets disabled again without your permission.
